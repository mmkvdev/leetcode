### 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II


### Problem Statement
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  ```[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]``` might become  ```[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]```).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

### Example 1:
```bash
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:
```bash
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

* Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
